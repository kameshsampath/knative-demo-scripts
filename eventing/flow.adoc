= Flow of the scripts

- Run `../cleanup.sh` to make sure we run with clean environment 

- Deploy the event source `./create-event-source.sh`

- Deploy the event sink `./create-event-sink.sh`

- Run `./sourceLogs.sh` to tail event source logs 

- Run `./sinkLogs.sh` to tail event sink logs

you will start to see the source sending message every `1 min` and the same will be logged in the sink

- Clean up `../cleanup.sh`
